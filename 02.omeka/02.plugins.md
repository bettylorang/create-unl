As you begin to use your Omeka install on Create UNL you may wish to add additional functionality by way of the various open source plugins available at [http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/). Although Omeka doesn't currently include an automated installer for plugins, the process of uploading them to your space is outlined here.

To get started you'll want to log in to your control panel (cPanel) at [https://createunl.com](https://createunl.com). In cPanel you'll access the File Manager located under the Files section.

In the File Manager you'll navigate on the lefthand sidebar down to your plugins folder which should be one of several folders within your Omeka install (your root directory for your domain is **public_html**).

Here you will see all plugins currently in your Omeka install. To add a new one you want to have downloaded the zip file locally to your computer from Omeka's website first. Then click the Upload button to upload the file.

The interface will allow you to drag and drop or select from your computer one or more zip files for the plugins you wish to upload. Once the upload has completed you can return to the previous screen using the link at the bottom of the page.

You should now see a zip file for your plugin in the plugins folder. The last step is to extract the contents of the zip file to the same folder. To do this select your file and click the Extract button.

Once the plugin is extracted you can delete the zip file and the plugin will now be available for activation within your Omeka administration interface.
