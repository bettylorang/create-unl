Your client area is located at [https://createunl.com](https://createunl.com) and includes access to your account profile, domain management, as well as full cPanel access.

Account logins are your MyUNL credentials.

**Note**: cPanel has its own account credentials that are used for FTP access and direct cPanel logins. When you access cPanel through the client area (Create UNL) your credentials are automatically passed into cPanel for you. For FTP, SSH, and direct cPanel logins, however, you will need these specific cPanel credentials. You should have these cPanel credentials in an email you reserved from support@createunl.com when you set up your account for the first time.
