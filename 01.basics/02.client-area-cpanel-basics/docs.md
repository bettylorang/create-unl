If you're slowly trying to understand your way through the world of websites, this might be the article for you. Signing up with Create UNL was easy enough, but now what? How do you begin to develop a domain of your own?

##### Client Area

When you log into your [Create UNL](https:createunl.com) account, you are taken to your **cPanel**. Your **cPanel** is your control panel to easily access and manage the files and applications of your account. Read below to understand the basics of your cPanel dashboard.

By deafult, cPanel will put the **Applicationss** section first on your dashboard. Note that you can change the order in which your tools appear in cPanel using the drag & drop method.


##### Files

The Files section in cPanel includes the following tools - File Manager, Images, Directory Privacy, Disk Usage, Web Disk, FTP accounts, FTP Connections, Backup and Backup Wizard. To truly see the capabilities of these tools, the best advice we can offer is just to click & explore. Reclaim Hosting has a tutorial specifically for Backups [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/faq/backing-up-your-site).

- **File Manager** allows you to manage all files connected to your account, including renaming, uploading, and deleting them. You can also get to your file manager using the *Quick Links* section at the top left of your cPanel.
- **Images** lets your manage images that have been previously saved to your account.
- **Directory Privacy** allows you to set a password to protect certain directories of your account.
- **Disk Usage** helps you monitor your account's available space.
- **File Transfer Protocol** (FTP) is a fast and convenient way to transfer large files online. Reclaim Hosting has a tutorial on FTP [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/miscellaneous/ftp-file-transfer-protocol).


##### Web Applications

Clicking on the Web Applications section will open Installatron; this is where you can install different applications (WordPress, Omeka, Scalar, etc.) to your domain.

Every users' cPanel will look a tad different depending on what applications they've installed. To understand more about web applications, click [here](http://docs.reclaimhosting.com/miscellaneous/what-exactly-is-a-web-application).
